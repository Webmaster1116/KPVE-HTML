# [Fitness: single page template](https://jasonbaciulis.github.io/fitness-template/) 

Fitness is a bright and vibrant template with large quality photos and fully responsive accross all devices. It is built on Bootstrap 4 framework.

Here you can find the [original PSD template](http://blazrobar.com/free-psd-website-templates/fitness-free-photoshop-psd-template/) created by [Blaz Robar](http://blazrobar.com/).

For scrolling effects I used [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) ScrollTo plugin and Bootstrap Scrollspy plugin.

## This project utilizes the best performance optimization practises using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/):

* All assets are minified, images and SVGs are optimized.
* For faster page load render blocking CSS is inlined in HTML and loaded asynchronously using [loadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS) function and [Critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical).
* Unused Bootstrap CSS is removed with [Purify CSS](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/purifycss-webpack).
* All external scripts are loaded from CDNs and are either defered or loaded async.
